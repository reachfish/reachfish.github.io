# Defination

# Process(Solution)
## Find relative
Find out map relation between question spaces and solved spaces. How can achieve this reflection?

## Controll complexity
Decompose question capicity.


# Rule
## Base Rule
Base rule is "easy". But rule combination can generate relative complicate rules.


# Complexity
Computer problem is not real. It's not a real physical problem with noise. Its units are abstract and without the physical restriction.

## Dec complexity tech

### Black-box abstraction
1. primitive objects 
   primitive procedues
   primitive data
2. means of combination
   procedue combination
   construction of compound data
3. means of abstraction 
   procedue defination 
   simple data abstraction 
4. capturing common patterns 
   high-order procedues
   data as procedues

### Conventional interfaces
1. generic operations
2. large-scale structure and modularity
3. object-oriented programming
4. operations on aggregates

### Meta-linguistic abstraction 
1. interpretation 
   apply-eval 
2. example logic programming 
3. register machines
